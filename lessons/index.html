      <h1>Lessons</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        One-on-one music tutoring on Auckland’s North Shore, for all skill levels.
        I specialise in vocals, acoustic guitar, and songwriting — always tailored to your goals and the music you love.
      </p>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Vocals</h2>
        <p>
          Personalised vocal coaching focused on building technique and confidence. We’ll work on the fundamentals
          (breath, placement, control, vocal health) and apply it directly to songs you want to sing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Acoustic guitar</h2>
        <p>
          Practical, song-first lessons. We can cover chords, rhythm, fingerpicking, learning songs efficiently,
          and (if you want) developing your ear and musical feel.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Songwriting</h2>
        <p>
          Write better songs and find your voice. We’ll explore chord progressions, melody, lyrics, structure,
          and break down great songs to see what makes them work — then apply it to your own writing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>
          One-on-one lessons in 30, 45, or 60 minute sessions. Based on the North Shore — feel free to ask about location/travel.
        </p>
