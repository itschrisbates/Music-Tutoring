      <h1>Lessons</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        I offer one-on-one music tutoring on Auckland’s North Shore, working with students of all skill levels.
        My focus is on vocals, acoustic guitar, and songwriting — with lessons shaped around your goals and the music you care about.
      </p>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Vocals</h2>
        <p>
          Vocal lessons are completely personalised. We’ll look at where you’re at, what you want to sing,
          and build the technique and confidence needed to get you there.
          Sessions can cover things like breath control, vocal placement, vocal health,
          and developing a stronger, more reliable voice — all applied directly to songs you enjoy singing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Acoustic Guitar</h2>
        <p>
          Guitar lessons are practical and song-focused. Whether you’re just starting out or already playing,
          we’ll work on chords, rhythm, fingerpicking, and learning songs in a way that feels natural and enjoyable.
          For more experienced players, we can also look at developing your ear and playing with more confidence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Songwriting</h2>
        <p>
          Songwriting lessons are about helping you find your own voice.
          We’ll explore chord progressions, melody, lyrics, and structure,
          and break down songs you love to understand what makes them work.
          The goal is to help you express yourself honestly and creatively through your own music.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="lesson-block">
        <h2>Lesson format</h2>
        <p>
          Lessons are one-on-one and available in 30, 45, or 60 minute sessions.
          I teach on the North Shore and can travel depending on the situation — feel free to ask.
