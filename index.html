    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Hey! I’m Chris Bates (BMus), and I teach singing, guitar and songwriting, based on the North Shore.
      As a child I learned the violin for a number of years, and at around age 13 I began to sing, play guitar and write songs.
      Over the last few years I’ve released music online as an artist, and performed around Auckland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve tutored music for the last 5 or so years, both younger and older. It’s a great pleasure to help guide aspiring musicians on their journey.
      All ages are welcome!
    </p>

        <h3>Singers</h3>
        <p>
          For my singers, we’ll firstly assess where you’re at, your strengths/weaknesses, and we’ll figure out together an appropriate plan
          and practice regiment that will get you starting to sing your ideal songs! My curriculum covers the essentials –
          breath control, placement, vocal execution, etc.

        <h3>Guitarists</h3>
        <p>
          For my guitarists, a similar approach, we’ll see where you’re at, I’ll help you with chords, strumming, fingerpicking,
          and general guidance on playing songs on guitar. For more advanced guitarists we’ll talk about how chords work,
          and how you can start to hear them without needing chord charts.

        <h3>Songwriters</h3>
        <p>
          For budding songwriters, this is always fun, we’ll talk about how to come up with your own chords progressions,
          and strong lyrics to match. We’ll listen to pop artists and try to break down their hit songs and see where the magic comes from.
          Ultimately, through your own songs, we’ll try to get you expressing yourself – which is what singing/making music is all about.
